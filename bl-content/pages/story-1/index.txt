<p dir="ltr">Creative intelligence and imagination are seminal to man's progress. If we can spot them and tap them to sprout in childhood,children will not only win in life....<!-- pagebreak -->but also lead a life with a sense of fulfilment. For all this to happen, the first thing to be done is to make the children become aware that they have all these transforming traits. With this mission in our mind, we approached the chairman of Aravinda School, Mrs Indrani. She received our idea with appreciative warmth and led us to interact with the students.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">As a prelude, our team asked the students class wise from 3rd to 9th to make pictorial drawings of a story which was made common to all. The suggested story was the popular one `Thirsty crow’. Our assessment of their finished work made it clear that all the presentations were of one of a kind with the same ambience running through all of them and with a crow perched on the rim of a pot’s mouth. </p>

<p dir="ltr">A workshop was conducted the very next day, wherein different kinds of environments, villages, towns and cities at large, deserts, forests and various species of animals, plants and trees, all placed in different contexts were introduced to the children through photo prints.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">We encouraged the students to make a pictorial presentation of the same story against the background of the newfound information that they imbibed. After a few hours of creative swimming, what was manifested was a stunning revelation. With the main story intact, there was a detailed portrayal of the ambience in different colours and of the context with clarity. There was an aura of innocent beauty in all of them. With little help, the creative skill of the youngsters gained a sharp refined edge.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Parents were invited to the exhibition of pictures on a display board. The students jostled in joy in order to draw their parent's attention to their own and their friend's achievements. Looking at the beaming faces of the elders our team was satisfied with the thought that ours was not a futile academic attempt. </p>

<p dir="ltr">We cherish the experience of this experimental program in ‘Aravinda school’ and the encouraging involvement of the staff students and the chairman Mrs Indrani. </p>
