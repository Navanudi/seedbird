<h2 dir="ltr">WHY SPONSOR A PROJECT?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Our community of project partners support and drives the humanitarian work we do. These inspiring individuals partner with Seed Bird Association to fund entire projects because they want to know that their generosity is being used strategically, in a scalable and sustainable way. We spend every rupee of their donations to empower teachers to reorganise school as a place to experience the real world for children, and farmers to go back to natural farming to save seed and soil to flourish, ensuring that their generosity is most efficiently used as a catalyst for change.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leave your mark on the world in a positive way by spreading wealth to those in need. Their lives will be changed for the good, as will yours.</p>
