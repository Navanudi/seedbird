<p>With every project, we are committed to creating an organic environment for education &amp; farming as we believe life is not linear, it is organic.</p>
<p>Our projects are focused on children, teachers, farmers &amp; farming communities.  We empower teachers to understand how children learn and help them to reorganise school as a place to experience the real world. </p>
<p>Farmers go back to natural farming to save indigenous seeds and soil to flourish.</p>
